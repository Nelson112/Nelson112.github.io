      <p2>
        The V&A Waterfront Clock Tower is situated <br>
        in Table Bay Harbour, close to the site of <br>
        the original Bertie's Landing restaurant. Much <br>
        of the Waterfront's charm lies in the fact <br>
        that this busy commercial harbour is set in the <br>
        midst of a huge entertainment venue with restaurants,<br>
        specialty shops, craft markets, theatres and movies.

      <p3>
        Walking to the pier head to stop over at the <br> Clock Tower precinct or to board the Robben Island <br> ferry brings you to the pedestrian swing bridge, an <br> innovative bridge designed to swing over the waterway to <br> allow shipping into and out of the Alfred Basin.<br>  The bridge is automatic but <br> can be manually operated in the event of failure.

      <p4>
        The considerable amount of time that has
         been devoted to sourcing African art has allowed us to establish close
         relationships with successive generations of
         Africa’s leading artists. We stock an immense array of objects
         d’art including sculpture, artifacts, ceramics, pottery
        bronzeware and glassware. Although our collection
         focuses on the work of recognised artists, we also devote
         display space to some of the younger, emerging artists from the African continent.”
